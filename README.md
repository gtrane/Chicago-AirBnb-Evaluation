Utilizing Python, this group project evaluated neighboorhoods in Chicago in terms of Airbnb listings, safety data, and median home sales, in order to evaluate the best neighborhood to begin an AirBnb.

I was responsible for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis of relevant AirBnb listings. Analyses involved creation of user-defined functions, interactive widgets, and data visualization techniques.

Through these analyses, my group identified Clearing as the "best" neighborhood to own and operate an Airbnb, as it passed our safety requirements and profitablility constraints.
